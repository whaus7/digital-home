      "The world of home automation simplifies our busy lives yet at the same time getting started can be a little intimidating for a beginning novice. DHT patiently helped me to select and design the right systems for my application. DHT working knowledge ensured we selected the right components which were compatible and scalable as my system grew over time. DHTV is committed to best in class service, quality and most importantly a job well done. Call them, I'm glad I did!",

      "DHT has done a couple of jobs for us in our home: installing a big screen television and related components last year and, more recently, putting in the Sonos home sound system. DHT is a pleasure to work with because he is able to explain technical issues in a way that even we, non-techies, understand. Their knowledge of the internet and electronic components is encyclopedic and, whether cutting into wallboard or working in the attic, work is neat and clean. DHT is meticulous, reliable, and thoroughly knowledgeable of the systems he installs. They are low-key and a pleasure to work with, and we recommend them to you without reservation.",

      "I heard a lot of different feedback about control 4. But after meeting DHTs and working with them through a new construction home I realize we could not have picked anyone better to automate our home. They are by far the best contractor we have worked within our project. There is no question or problem they do not have the answer for. Highly recommend them to anyone who is thinking of automating their home. Thank you DHT.",

They also clearly explain how to handle sophisticated equipment in a user friendly way. We will be sure to continue to use their services in the future.",
